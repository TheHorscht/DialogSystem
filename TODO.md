Auto resizing the box based on content
The ability to display the reply options inline horizontally, for example in my survey call i have [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], which wastes a lot of space currently.
The ability to set the typing sound interval directly (i added this in the fairmod version of dialog system)
The ability to hide options when not available, instead of greying them out
Auto wrapping text that is too wide for the box

Somehow check if script_interacting and script_source_file point to the same file, to make sure they use the same lua context

Make portait optional
Make portrait resizable
